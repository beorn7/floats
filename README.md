# Floats

A [Go](http://golang.org) library with utilities for floats.

For now, there are only functions to compare floats according to
[floating-point-gui.de](http://floating-point-gui.de/errors/comparison/).

As a side-effect, it provides values for the minimum positive
normal value of `float32` and `float64`.
